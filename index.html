			To prevent the analysis from being skewed purely by the number of songs released, the vocabularies are compared across the 100 densest songs (by total number of words) that they have released. Only 6 of these musicians have released less than 100 songs, so it is a good threshold. Also, 100 songs comprises 8 to 10 albums of music which would span at least 5 to 10 years of work which should give a fair idea of the overall vocabulary of these musicians. 		<br/>Here are some definitions you should be acquanited with
			<br/><br/>
			&#8226; <span class = "defHighlight"><em>VOCABULARY SIZE</em></span> The number of unique words (across any language) used by a musician in 100 (or less) densest songs across their career.
			<br/><br/>
			&#8226; <span class = "defHighlight"><em>LYRICAL DENSITY</em></span> The total number of words (across any language) used by a musician in 100 (or less) densest songs across their career.
			<br/><br/>
			&#8226; <span class = "defHighlight"><em>LEARNING RATE</em></span> On average, the number of words after which a new word is used by the musician. This is the ratio of Lyrical density/Vocabulary. A low learning rate means new words are used frequently.

		These superstars have released songs in multiple popular languages. Their vocabularies in different languages are getting summed up leading to a high overall vocabulary size. This was a result I was not expecting when I started the analysis.

Some simple insights can still be taken. Hip-Hop is way ahead of the other genres (d’oh). Folk comes in second but since there is only one folk artist (Bob Dylan) in the analysis it is not representative at all. Pop is the genre with the most number of musicians and its average vocabulary size (2464 words) is close to the average vocabulary size across all artists (2677 words). Same thing applies to the Rock genre as well.

	There is a large variation of vocabulary size in the 93 top selling musicians and there is no overall correlation between the commercial success of a musician and their vocabulary size.
	<br/><br/>
	This analysis should not be interpreted as saying that one musician is better than the other, it is just another insight into the work of these amazing artists. It gives us a peek into the minds of different songwriters, some tear your heart with just a few words while others paint an intricate picture with a thousand words.
	Quoting John Lennon out of context explains this songwriter dilemma quite well -

		All the lyrics data and other metadata (images, album lists, track lists, etc) is extracted using the <a href = "http://developer.musixmatch.com" target = "blank">Musixmatch api</a>. Python is used for fetching the data and analysing the lyrics. The analysis could be improved to remove coincidental sounds (ooh, aah, etc) and other such words which are not part of a dictionary. The data and the code will be released if anyone is interested.
		<br/><br/>
		<a href = "http://experiments.undercurrent.com" target = "blank">The largest vocabulary in hip hop</a> compares the vocabulary of various musicians across the first 35000 words written by them. Instead of constraining by the number of words we used the <b>100 densest</b> songs. Just out of curiosity (and for the sake of completeness) we used the same methodology by considering <b>10000 words</b> written by each artist. The results of the two approaches don’t differ too much, the top 5 ranked musicians remain the same. The top 10 ranked musicians are the same with a slight shuffling of the ranks. Andrea Bocelli moves from #8 to #6, while Black Eyed Peas move from rank #6 to #7 and Julio Iglesias from #7 to #8. No significant changes are observed on the whole (<a href = "http://i.imgur.com/z2H9T6i.png" target = "blank">more details</a>). Thus, we used 100 songs as the constraint since it makes more sense intuitively and musically.
